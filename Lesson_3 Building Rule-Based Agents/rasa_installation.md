 ## Use a Clean Virtual Environment and Install the Latest Rasa

Here’s how to do it **step-by-step on Windows**:

---

### 💡 Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment (outside Anaconda)

Open **Command Prompt** (not Anaconda Prompt), then run:

```bash
mkdir rasa_bot
cd rasa_bot
python 3.10 -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

You should now see `(venv)` in your prompt.

---

### 💡 Step 2: Upgrade `pip` and Install Compatible Rasa Version

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```

Then install the latest **Rasa Open Source** (e.g., v3.6.x or newer):

```bash
pip install rasa >3.4
```

✅ This should install a version compatible with modern Python (>=3.8). You’ll avoid the outdated dependencies like `absl-py==0.9.0`.

---

### 💡 Step 3: Verify Installation

```bash
rasa --version
```

You should see something like:

```
Rasa 3.6.x
Python 3.10.x
```

---

### ⚠️ If You Must Use Anaconda

It's technically possible, but Rasa doesn't officially support Anaconda environments due to compatibility issues with TensorFlow and event loops. It's much more reliable using `venv`.

Creating a **rule-based FAQ bot using Rasa** is a great way to get started! Here's a step-by-step guide to help you build a simple rule-based FAQ bot that responds with predefined answers.

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step: Rule-Based FAQ Bot with Rasa

### 🧰 1. **Install Rasa**

If you haven't installed Rasa yet:

```bash
pip install rasa
```

Create a new Rasa project:

```bash
rasa init --no-prompt
cd my_project  # Or the name of your project folder
```

---

### 📁 2. **Define Intents and FAQs in `nlu.yml`**

Edit `data/nlu.yml`:

```yaml
version: "3.1"
nlu:
- intent: faq_what_is_rasa
  examples: |
    - What is Rasa?
    - Can you tell me about Rasa?
    - Define Rasa
    - What's Rasa?

- intent: faq_how_to_install
  examples: |
    - How do I install Rasa?
    - Installation steps for Rasa?
    - How to set up Rasa?
```

---

### 💬 3. **Add Responses in `domain.yml`**

Edit `domain.yml`:

```yaml
version: "3.1"

intents:
  - faq_what_is_rasa
  - faq_how_to_install

responses:
  utter_faq_what_is_rasa:
    - text: "Rasa is an open-source framework for building conversational AI."

  utter_faq_how_to_install:
    - text: "You can install Rasa with 'pip install rasa'."
```

---

### 🔁 4. **Define Rules in `rules.yml`**

Edit `data/rules.yml`:

```yaml
version: "3.1"
rules:
- rule: Answer what is Rasa
  steps:
    - intent: faq_what_is_rasa
    - action: utter_faq_what_is_rasa

- rule: Answer how to install
  steps:
    - intent: faq_how_to_install
    - action: utter_faq_how_to_install
```

---

### 🧠 5. **Train the Bot**

```bash
rasa train
```

---

### 🧪 6. **Test Your Bot**

Run the shell for testing:

```bash
rasa shell
```

Try typing:

* "What is Rasa?"
* "How do I install Rasa?"

The bot should respond with the answers you defined in `domain.yml`.

---

### ✅ Optional: Add Fallback

To handle unknown questions, add a fallback in `config.yml` or with a rule. I can help you with that too if you'd like.
