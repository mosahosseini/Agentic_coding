# Lesson 2: Introduction to LLMs & Prompt Engineering

**Topics:**
1. How LLMs work (transformers, tokens, inference)
2. OpenAI API / Hugging Face transformers
3. Basic prompting (zero-shot, few-shot)

## 1 How LLMs work
LLM stand for Large Language Models and is the AI breakthrough of the recent years. Language models a predictive model that are used to predict the next token/word given n previouse word. I will not go though the transformer architecture in datail i will just give you a quick overview on how does it work and how the chat interfaces like chatgpt are built. 


Exercise:
Create a CLI chatbot using gpt-3.5-turbo.
